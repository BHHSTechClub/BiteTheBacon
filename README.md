Bite the Bacon

The Game:
Bite the Bacon is a 2-player game. The players slide along an infinitely long piece of bacon, biting holes in it. The goal is to get the other player to fall through a hole. Streaks of fat will speed up the player when sliding, but slow down the player after he/she bites the fat.

The Code:
We are trying to follow an MVC architecture here. Here's a brief overview:
The code is split into three parts - the model, view, and controller. The model controls the program's flow and is where everything gets computed. The view controls the display. The controller manages user input and data storage, if needed.
Try to follow this architecure as closely as possible. Add comments where they are needed. Make your code readable.
